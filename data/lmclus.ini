# used to select the maximum dimensionality of linear manifold clusters the algorithm will search for, starting with dimensionality 1.
MAX_DIM = 5
# maximum number of clusters we expect to see in the data. It is used as a heuristic to compute a sample size 
# that guarantees with probability that we sample points coming from the same cluster. 
# By no means does this parameter predetermine the number of clusters output by the algorithm as in K-means.
NUM_OF_CLUS = 10
#is a histogram 'goodness of separation' threshold, which the higher it is set the more coarse the clustering will be, and the lower it is set the finer the clustering will be.
BEST_BOUND = 1.0
# a bound on the probability (epsilon) of not sampling points coming from the same cluster using the sampling heuristic.

# create histograms with a constant number of bins. if value equals zero, histograms of variable sizes will be generated, according to some heuristic. 
# If value greater than zero than that value will be the number of bins.
CONST_SIZE_HIS = 0
# maximum number of points (portion) in a histogram's bin. Does not matter if CONST_SIZE_HIS>0.
MAX_BIN_PORTION = 0.1
# this value is used to determine the minimum number of points that may be considered as a cluster. 
# blocks of data containing less points than this value will not be partitioned or will be considered noise.
NOISE_SIZE = 20
# used to determine whether or not the random generator will use a different seed for each execution. 
# A value equal to zero will cause the random seed to change from one program execution to another yeilding different samples. 
# A value greater than zero will be used as constant seed for the current execution. this value should be compatible with an unsigned long int.
RANDOM_SEED = 34498
# switch {1,2,3}, used to determine which heuristic is used to compute the number of manifold samples: 
# 1 - algorithm will use a probabilistic heuristic which will sample a quantity exponential in 'max dim' and 'max num of clusters' input paparmeters; 
# 2 - will sample N (number of points in the dataset)*SAMPLING_FACTOR; 
# 3 - the lesser of the previous two. Note that 1 should not be used for high dimensional manifolds and a large number of clusters, as it will generate a very large number. 
# Therefore it is recomended to use option 3, which causes the number of sampled manifolds to be bounded by option 2.
SAMPLING_HEURISTIC = 3
# when the second or third option is used as the sampling heuristic then this value will be multiplied by the number of points in the dataset.
SAMPLING_FACTOR = 0.003
# true- will sample points to create the distance histograms to improve the efficiency of the algorithm;
